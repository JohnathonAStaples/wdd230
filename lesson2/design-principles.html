            <p>Hick's Law or Hick-Hyman Law is a psycological test to test your stimuli. They are seeing if you have
                less options if you can make a quicker decision or if having more options will. They determined that the
                fewer the option you have unless you have a decision before viewing it will be quicker no matter if
                there are more or less choices. If there are less choices they can make a quicker decision the more
                choice it may also make them not make one because it is to overwhelming.</p>

            <img src="images/hierarchy.png" alt="Screen shot of visual hierarchy">
            <p>As it sounds with visual hierarchy you want the first thing you see the most important thing that you
                see. Working your way down to the least important thing.The most important thing to see may not even
                been your logo it might be what you are trying to sell or have people see that needs to been seen first.

            <img src="images/thirds.png" alt="Screen shot of Rules of Thirds">
            <p>The rules of thirds is also applied to things like art and photography. Just like those a website is the
                same art we see things with our eyes and see if it is appealing or not and we scan using a grid system
                basicly from the top left as the majority of it to the right and cinter the least we look would be the
                bottom right expecially when looking at a website because we know what we are looking at is in the dead
                center.</p>
