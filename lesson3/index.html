        <h2>The Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is for school and do what I am asked so I can get a good grade. This is going to be
            a fictional page for Garden of the Gods which is a place here in Colorado Springs. In the long run it will
            be multiple assignments which I do not know everything exactly what we will be doing each week. This will be
            the home page which will include the Site name Which is Garden of the Gods Chamber.</p>
        <p>
            It will also have a logo on the page which will appear. Links to go to the target-audience where my personas
            and scenarios will be. A link for the design which will include the color schema and the typography which
            you will see throught the page. </p>
